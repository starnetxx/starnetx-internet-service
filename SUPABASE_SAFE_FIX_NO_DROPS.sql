-- ULTRA SAFE FIX - NO DROPS, ONLY FIXES
-- This version has NO destructive operations

-- ============================================
-- STEP 1: ANALYZE THE PROBLEM (READ ONLY)
-- ============================================

-- Check for ID mismatches between auth.users and profiles
SELECT 
  'AUTH USERS vs PROFILES CHECK' as check_type,
  au.id as auth_user_id,
  au.email as auth_email,
  p.id as profile_id,
  p.email as profile_email,
  CASE 
    WHEN p.id IS NULL THEN 'Missing profile'
    WHEN au.id != p.id THEN 'ID MISMATCH - THIS IS THE PROBLEM!'
    ELSE 'OK'
  END as status
FROM auth.users au
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON p.email = au.email
ORDER BY au.created_at DESC;

-- Show the exact mismatches that need fixing
SELECT 
  'PROFILES THAT NEED ID FIX' as issue,
  p.id as current_wrong_id,
  au.id as should_be_id,
  p.email
FROM profiles p
JOIN auth.users au ON p.email = au.email
WHERE p.id != au.id;

-- ============================================
-- STEP 2: FIX ID MISMATCHES (SAFE UPDATES ONLY)
-- ============================================

-- First, let's see what would be updated (preview only)
SELECT 
  'PREVIEW: Profiles to update' as action,
  COUNT(*) as profiles_to_fix
FROM profiles p
JOIN auth.users au ON p.email = au.email

-- Fix profile IDs to match auth.users IDs
-- This is SAFE - only updates the ID field to match auth
UPDATE profiles p
SET id = au.id
FROM auth.users au
WHERE p.email = au.email
  AND p.id != au.id
RETURNING 'Updated profile for: ' || p.email as fixed;

-- Fix transactions to point to correct user IDs
WITH profile_mapping AS (
  SELECT 
    old_p.id as old_id,
    au.id as new_id
  FROM profiles old_p
  JOIN auth.users au ON old_p.email = au.email

FROM profile_mapping pm
WHERE t.user_id = pm.old_id
RETURNING 'Updated transactions for user_id: ' || pm.old_id || ' -> ' || pm.new_id as fixed;

-- Fix credential_pools if needed
WITH profile_mapping AS (
  SELECT 
    old_p.id as old_id,
    au.id as new_id
  FROM profiles old_p
  JOIN auth.users au ON old_p.email = au.email
  WHERE old_p.id != au.id

WHERE cp.assigned_to = pm.old_id

-- ============================================
-- STEP 3: ADD SIMPLE WORKING POLICIES (NON-DESTRUCTIVE)
-- ============================================

-- STEP 4: VERIFY EVERYTHING IS FIXED
-- ============================================

-- Final verification
